Initiative tracking and utilities

This is a fairly simple tool for tracking d20-based RPG combat timing.  It's also a "jukebox" of sorts so that you can set up music playlists to set the mood for your play sessions.
The playlists can be set up before hand and switched by simply selecting them from the listbox on the main interface.
Playlists can also be set up for "notification" sounds to let everyone know when the current combat time mark is changed.
Each list has an independently-tracked volume adjustment for those tracks that are very quiet or very loud.
